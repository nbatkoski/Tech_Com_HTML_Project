        <h2>Overview</h2>

            <p>Constructing a research paper is an integral part of being a graduate student in the 
                Information Architecture, Technical Communication and Information Design, and Technical 
                Communication programs at IIT.</p1>
            <p>There is no right or wrong way to put a paper together, 
                but there are a wealth of tools available to 
                make the process efficient and manageable. In this course, you will find an explanation of the 
                basic steps involved in writing a research paper, as well as a selection of tools 
                that complement certain steps.</p>
            <p>If you are new to writing research papers, t
                his course will guide you through each of the basic steps; even 
                if you are an experienced writer, you can still refresh your knowledge with one or more lessons.
